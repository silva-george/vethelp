# vethelp

To run the program, use the terminal command in the `vethelp` directory:

- **Windows**: `python -m UI.py`
- **Linux**: `python3 -m UI.py`

It is important to run it as a **module** (`-m`) to apply all the imports.

The application starts with an **admin** account created with the login `admin` and password `123`.

Users created by the admin **do not have a password** (the feature to create a password on the first UI access has not been implemented yet).

**Still under construction**
